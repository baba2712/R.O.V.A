# ROVA
Robotic Operational Versatile Assistant

ROVA is a robotic assistant designed to help with fall detection, emergency alerts, and human assistance requests.

## Features
Core Safety Features:
Fall Detection and Response

ROVA detects falls using accelerometer/gyroscope sensors.
If the fallen individual doesnâ€™t respond, ROVA sends alerts to nearby humans or devices.
Emergency Alert System

In case of emergencies (e.g., fall or intruder detection), ROVA sends real-time notifications to pre-configured contacts or nearby devices.
Autonomous Functionality:
Autonomous Navigation

Equipped with ultrasonic or LiDAR sensors, ROVA navigates its environment, avoiding obstacles and ensuring safe movement.
It can autonomously return to a charging station when the battery is low.
Basic Mobility

ROVA can move in all directions and adjust speed based on the environment.
AI and Interaction:
GPT-4 Integration

Enables natural and intelligent conversations, making ROVA user-friendly and adaptable to various commands.
Human Assistance Request

If ROVA detects a problem, such as a non-responsive individual, it approaches nearby humans to seek help.
Security and Surveillance:
Intruder Detection
ROVA monitors its surroundings using a camera or PIR sensor to detect intruders and alerts users of suspicious activity.
